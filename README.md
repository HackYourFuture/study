# Hack Your Future Study Book

A giant collection of awesome knowledge and resources to help you succeed at HYF and beyond. The goal of this repository is to be the one tab you can't help but pin.

This study book is the work of all the different HYF chapters in different countries. We have gathered all of our combined knowledge about the programming topics you as a student will be learning as well as some extra topics you will be encountering after you have finished your curriculum.

## Contributions are appreciated!

> The world of programming is never stationary, so help us keep this up to date!

Let us know if something on a topic is outdated, or something can be explained more clearly. Students/mentors/coaches, anyone is free to add suggestions!

### How to contribute

If you're reading this on GitBook, there's a button (:octocat: __Edit on GitHub__) in the upper right-hand-corder that will open to the main repo.

From there you can directly send a patch or PR.

* Do you know a great resource we've missed?  Send a Pull Request / Patch with the link.
* Links in all languages are welcome! Just let everyone know what language it is in with a little comment - (tr), (ru), ...
* Was a certain link super helpful? Send us a patch with a `+` after the link.  The more `+` the more helpful!
* Was a link not very helpful, or even confusing? Send us a patch with a `-` after the link. If a link has too many `-` and not enough `+`, we'll remove it.
* All good things come to an end. If you find a link that has gone dead, send us a Patch with a `X` after the link.
* Are we missing an important topic? Send a PR with a new folder or file (and a link to it in the `SUMMARY.md`, to keep the GitBook up-to-date ;)). Make sure to check out [this guide](./contributing.md) to see the guide to topic structure.

### Markdown

This book is fully written in Markdown. Markdown is so important to open source development that it deserves to be on this front page, and simple enough that you'll never need more than a few references:
