# Conditional statements

Computers only function by logical rules: whether something is true or not determines if an instructions gets executed or not. This logical process is expressed in a `conditional statement` and goes like this: if _this is the case_, then _that happens_. Or in code:

```js
if (/* this is the case */) {
  // then this will happen
}
```

A condition is put in the `( )` and it needs to evaluate to `true` or `false` (also known as `Boolean` values). If the condition is true, then whatever is inside the `{ }` will be executed.

What happens when the condition is false? For that we have the `else { }` block. If the condition is false, then whatever is inside the else will be executed:

```js
if() {

} else {

}

```
