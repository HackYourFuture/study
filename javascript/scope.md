# Scope

One of the central concepts in programming is the idea of `context`: the meaning of any particular thing is only determined in relation to its direct surroundings. Let's take language for example. If I say the following sentence:

> I never said she stole my money.

Reading this it's not obvious how to interpret what the situation is about. Depending on the emphasis of the words it could mean any of the following:

- _I_ never said she stole my money.
- I _never_ said she stole my money.
- I never _said_ she stole my money.
- I never said _she_ stole my money.
- I never said she _stole_ my money.
- I never said she stole _my_ money.
- I never said she stole my _money_.

It depends on `context` for me to know what really happened.

Let's draw the line to programming. Simply put, just like context gives meaning to a word, `scope` gives meaning to a variable/object.

That meaning is defined by whether or not the variable is accessible. If the variable is not within the "scope" of any given code block, it can't access it. Which means it doesn't exist from the perspective of that code block.

This is actually a good thing: we want to make sure that parts of our data have limited accessibility. Imagine that the password to your email account would be available everywhere, and you could easily get access to it by writing some code in the console of your browser. Do you know how easily it would be to hack into your account?

Scope sounds simple, but is actually hard to wrap your head around. Wilgert has made another video to help you out:

### Global vs. local (function and block)

Scope can be divided into two basic types: global and local scope. In any given application, there is one global scope. But there can be many local scopes. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope and is therefore accessible from anywhere in the code. Variables declared within a local scope are only accessible within that scope.

Local scope can be further divided into two categories: function and block. Let's look at **function scope** first.

A unique local scope gets created whenever a function is declared. The variables declared within will only be accessible within that scope, nowhere else. This makes it possible to declare variables within the same name in each different local scope. This also means that it's not possible to refer to a variable declared in one local scope, within another local scope.

```js
function createLocalScope() {
  const localVariable = 'this variable can only be accessed within this function';
  console.log(localVariable);

  const localOnlyHere = 'This variable can only be accessed here, nowhere else';
}

function createAnotherLocalScope() {
  const localVariable =
    "Even though this variable has the same name, it has nothing to do with the other localVariable, because it doesn't exist outside of that function";
  console.log(localVariable);
  console.log(localOnlyHere);
}

createLocalScope();
createAnotherLocalScope();
```

However, variables declared within the global scope can be accessed anywhere! Actually, that's the very purpose of global scope. In the context of functions this means that you don't have to pass it as an argument, but that you can directly refer to it within the function.

```js
const globalVariable = 'This variable can be accessed wherever in the code';

function accessGlobalVariable() {
  console.log(globalVariable);
}
console.log(globalVariable);
accessGlobalVariable();
```

The second type of local scope is called **block scope**. A block, generally speaking, is any code wrapped within `{ }`. This includes conditional statements (`if` and `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while` and `do/while`).

### Const and let

In the ES6 syntax, which is now the standard in the software development world, we prefer to declare variables using `const` and `let`. This is because the keywords are more descriptive and restrictive. This makes them easier to work with.

In relation to scope both also behave differently: they are block scoped. This means that they can be accessed from outside a `{ }`.
