# User Registration

If we would like to build a multi-user application, it is essential to store and track a list of all the allowed users to the application. In addition, we should also implement authentication and authorization.
* Authentication system will prevent users to impersonate and make actions as other users.
* Authorization system will prevent users from accessing resources that they are not allowed to be accessed.

## Registration implementation

In order to track the list of users, we often use a `user database`. This database will securely keep all the information about every user that is required for our application. This often includes the authentication credentials such as password.
