## API's and Express

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment capable of writing Web Servers and API's all by itself.  But it's a bit annoying.  Express is a great and easy to use framework to help you write API's and Web Servers by handling all of the boring stuff for you so you can focus on what your app does.

> [Postman](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=postman+tutorials&t=brave&iax=videos&ia=videos) - an app for testing your API's without using a browser.

> [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - An NPM module that starts a RESTful API without you having to write a single line of code.  This can be helpful practice for getting the hang of API's and Postman without getting tripped up by bugs and errors in code you write.
