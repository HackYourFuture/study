# Postman

When creating APIs it is important to test if they work as intended. The easiest way to do this is to send a request and check the API's response.

Normally, you would send a request using the browser or the command line. But there's a tool we can use that's made especially for these testing purposes:

Postman offers an intuitive graphical user interface that will help us visualize API requests and the responses we get.

You can install Postman by following [these steps](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates).

As you can see in the image below, when you enter a request in Postman and click the Send button, the server receives your request and returns a response that Postman then displays in the interface.

If you just want to try postman out a bit, you can query any open API (you can search through some open ones [here](https://public-apis.io/), or you can use the following module [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). This NPM module starts a RESTful API without you having to write a single line of code.
