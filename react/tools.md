# React Tools

There are a lot of tools available for the React developer that you can make use of.

## Create-react-app
The React team themselves have provided a tool to quickly set up a React application with Babel, webpack and ESLint already configured. It also makes sure that the instant reload functionality is set up so that your app updates on any change you make to the code.

This means you can focus on learning React!

Have a look at the official site: https://create-react-app.dev/.

One of our volunteers has also made a movie to explain this setup and what Babel is in the following video:

## Static hosting
React in itself creates what is called a `build` which is all your code converted into JavaScript that the browser can understand. In essence this is a static amount of code that we can host. There are many static site hosting platforms that make it easy to deploy your React applications.

The host creates a URL for us that we can use to access our website.

Examples of `static site hosting` platforms are the following:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Now](https://zeit.co/)

To learn more about `static site hosting` and how to do it, study the following:
