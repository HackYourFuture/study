# Tracing Execution

The debuggers built into Browsers and VSC are outstanding. If you already understand how your code is interpreted and executed they will be indispensible tools for stepping through program execution to find your mistakes.  But they aren't beginner's tools.

If you don't already understand how JS interprets and executes your code you'll find the debuggers (and your code!) a frustrating mystery. So before diving 100% into the debugger, spend a few weeks stepping through (and predicting) small snippets in JS Tutor.  Your future self will thank you.
