# GitKraken

This is a [Git Gui](./gui-clients.md), it allows you visualize what is happening in your project and to do Git things (add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, ...)  by clicking buttons instead of typing commands into terminal.  GitKraken will be overwhelming at the beginning but will help you to be more productive faster, and to build a better understanding of what is happening inside git.

GitKraken is the recommended Git Client for HYF, but you are free to use any other git client you want.  Or to just use terminal! (which is the ultimate goal anyway ;).  We've chosen GitKraken because:

1. It works on Linus, Windows & Mac so you can all learn the same software to can help each other out
1. Their website has pretty good docs & introductory videos for beginner git users
1. It has clean and helpful visualizations of what is happening in your git repository
