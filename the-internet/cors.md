# Cross Origin Resources Sharing (CORS)

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. You may come across CORS when you want to fetch data from a Web API. So what is it?

As per Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation:

> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

While you should already be familiar with [HTTP headers](./http.md), at this point you may be asking yourself:

- What is an `origin`?
- What is this header based mechanism?
- Why do I need to know about CORS?
- How can I deal with it?

No worries, we will answer those questions in the following part.

## What is CORS ?

Let's imagine that we have an application available at `https://my-super-application.com/index.html`. When we open the application using our Web browser, it will fetch a set of resources defined in the `index.html`. Example of resources are a `css` file, some `js` scripts and maybe one or two `png`. The following resources are loaded without any issue:

- `https://my-super-application.com/index.html`
- `https://my-super-application.com/style.css`
- `https://my-super-application.com/script.js`
- `https://my-super-application.com/images/background.png`
- `https://my-super-application.com/images/logo.png`

The browser has no issues loading them. The application is working just fine! Now we want to rely on [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) to query new resources on the web *(Note: While fetch is a more modern implementation, both ways offer similar capabilities)*.

The user does something on our page, like clicking a button to display a new image. In the first version of the application, the image is stored at the same web site. We can use `fetch` to get the resource at `https://my-super-application.com/images/super-image.png`:

```js
async function getImage() {
  const response = await fetch("https://my-super-application.com/images/super-image.png");
  return await response.blob();
}
```

It works without any issue! But now, for some reason, we want the image to come from another location or, stated more correctly, from another *origin*. For example, We want the user to see the image from `https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Strip-La-joie-du-message-derreur-english650-final.jpg`.

> Now is the right time to explain what is an [Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) when we talk about the Web. The Web uses HTTP as its core protocol to exchange resources in a [REST](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) fashion. Each resource is identified by its [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL). The [Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) is defined by the **scheme** (protocol), **hostname** (domain), and **port** of the URL used to identify and access a resource. Two resources have the same origin only when the **scheme**, **hostname**, and **port** all match.

The origin of the new image (`https://www.commitstrip.com`) is different compared to our application origin (`https://my-super-application.com`).  It means that we are requesting a resource from a different origin and therefore making a **cross-origin request**.

Back to my application, when requesting `https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Strip-La-joie-du-message-derreur-english650-final.jpg`. On the origin server, CORS is not configured to allow users to fetch resource from our application, and more precisely our application's *origin*. Requests are blocked by the browser and we get the following error:

![CORS Error](assets/cors-error.png)

## Why CORS?

But why do we need CORS and why can't users access resource from any Origin? Because browsers try to protect users from [CSRF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF) attacks!

Let's imagine that we are authenticated with our bank website at `my-bank.com`. When browsing we may visit an attacker website by clicking a link. Once we have loaded the attacker website, without us knowing, they could make requests to `my-bank.com` on our behalf using the authenticated session stored in our browser. Then, they may be able to transfer money from our account to another account. The [Same-Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy?ea-publisher=javadecompilerscom) enforced by our browser protects us from this kind of attack!

Without [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and because of the [Same-Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy?ea-publisher=javadecompilerscom), we wouldn't be able to load resource from 3rd Party websites and APIs making the web less vibrant üòø.

Thanks to CORS, the browser and the web server are able to exchange headers (prefixed with `Access-Control-*`). The headers define how the resources can be consumed by a web browser.

## How should I work with CORS?

**At this stage, you SHOULD not worry about CORS configuration and complexity!**

It is good to know what it is and why it exists. But in most cases, libraries and frameworks will take care of that for you!

Most Public APIs should allow requests from any Origin. If it is not the case, you should move to another API.
