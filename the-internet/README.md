### Browsers

In the simplest definition, a browser is an application that imports and renders HTML, CSS & JS from anywhere in the internet.  Check out the resources below for a better overview.

### Web Apps

In simplest words a web application is just software that its split across the internet.  The part you see runs on your computer, but it talks with other parts anywhere in the world using HTTP.   Those other parts usually do all the hard work.

### HTTP

It's sort of like a secret code that everyone knows.  For now you just need to know that it exists, you'll get plenty of time to understand it when you build API's.
