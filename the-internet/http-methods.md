# HTTP Methods

Like verbal communication, there's the _content_ (WHAT you are saying) and the _style_ (HOW you are saying it). HTTP refers to the \***\*style\*\*** of online communication. How you communicate over the web is done through specific HTTP methods (also called HTTP verbs), that describe what type of request is being made. The most important ones are:

- **GET**. This type of request is only about getting data from the server. Whenever a user enters a new webpage, a GET request is sent to the server to get the required files to display that webpage. All other data in the website stays unaffected.
- **POST**. This type of request allows the client to submit new data to the server. Generally speaking, its purpose is to store this new data into a database, or manipulate it and later return it to the client.
- **PUT**. This type of request allows the client to update existing data, which is already present in the client. The data is edited and then send back to the server, similar to the POST request, but more semantic.
- **DELETE**. This type of request tells the server to delete a particular set of data or resources.

Why do you need to know all of this? HTTP is the foundation of how client-server interactions work on the web. It's important to have a universal policy that everyone holds on to, to have fast and effective online communication.

Have a look at the following videos that explain the client-server interactions:
