# Topic

> essence

Explain the topic in a few sentences, focusing on _why_ it's important to learn and practice.

---

## Explanation

Explain the topic in detail including images, snippets, videos, ... whatever helps make things clear.

To embed a video use the following code:

```
{% youtube src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" %}{% endyoutube %}
```

{% youtube src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" %}{% endyoutube %}

---

## Examples

Include some well-commented and _fully working_ examples for students to explore. Depending on the topic this is a good place to embed some sandboxes. If the topic cannot be hosted with codesandbox (ie. bash scripts), please include the example scripts as a code block with instructions for students to use them in their local machine.

For embedded code, codesandbox is the preferred environment. To embed it go to the sandbox and click on the embed button to the top right. There will be a link on the left (not the iframe one). Remember to also set it to dark theme. For example:

```
{% codesandbox %}
https://codesandbox.io/s/charming-cdn-57lm0?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark
{% endcodesandbox %}
```

{% codesandbox %}
https://codesandbox.io/s/charming-cdn-57lm0?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark
{% endcodesandbox %}

## Exercises

Time for some practice! Include some codesandboxes or snippets for students to complete as exercises. Exercises might be scripts with missing code and comments, tests to pass, applications to debug, ... use your imagination.

## Further Study

Include a list of links and other resources for students who are interested in a different perspective, or would like to go further in this topic.
